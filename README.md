# Novel Open Variable Annotator
NovA is a tool for annotating and analyzing behaviours in social interactions. It allows to load data recorded with the SSI Framework, as well as from external sources. It further makes use of SSI for semi-automated labeling of behaviours for example by automatically detecting specific gestures from a Kinect (or Kinect 2) Sensor or facial expressions from video.

NovA has been completly reworked with more advanced annotation features. It now allows framewise labeling for a more precise coding experience, and continuous annotations for labeling e.g emotions or social attitudes (see picture below). The interface is more customizable than the last version and allows loading and labeling data of multiple persons.

The Annotation format can easily be imported in other tools, like ELAN or Excel. NovA further supports the Import of Discrete Annotation files from ELAN and ANVIL for a seamless workflow. Annotations further can directly be transformed into SSI samplelists for training models.
Additionally it's now possible to store/load annotations in a local or external MongoDB database for a cooperative workflow (basic support).

The new reworked version is now online for Download.

###FAQ:

<strong>Help, I opened a video but it doesn't show up</strong>

Please make sure you installed the according Video Codec on your System. E.g. The K-Lite Codec Pack might be a good solution for most missing codecs.

<strong>Will NovA run on my Mac/Linux Machine?</strong>

As NovA is an WPF Application it will run on Windows. Nevertheless you can of course use a Virtual Machine to use it.

<strong>I found a bug, can you fix it?</strong>

NovA is  Software under development and is provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù. If you run into any problems or find bugs (or want to contribute to the project) feel free to open an issue here on github.

<strong>Is there an example pipeline to automatically create annotations?</strong>

An example SSI Pipeline for recording a wide range of interessting features will be provided in the next update (as it existed for the old version, but updated for Kinect 2, and some more new features üôÇ ).
